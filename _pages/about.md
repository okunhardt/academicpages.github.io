I am an undergraduate student studying computer science and mathematics at CUNY Hunter College. I also serve as an undergraduate teaching assistant for the Computer Science Department. Other than taking classes and teaching, I am a researcher. I am primarily interested in explainable artificial intelligence. I am currently examining the role of image distribution and task in the inherent adversarial robustness of artificial neural network models.
